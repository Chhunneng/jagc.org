Just Another Golf Coding

JAGC is a server for [code golf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf),
where users should write the shortest code using all standard features of scripting languages
for solve tasks. Users can add new tasks with unit tests and invent solutions and submit them.
JAGC will run tests for these solutions to determine the winner.
